# Web Applications UK - Core Libraries

![Branding](images/UK Logo (Black).png)

## Description

This library contains a treasure trove of utilities built up over a decade by Web Applications UK for simplifying the building and deployment of enterprise scale .NET solutions. The code has been successfully used, in various forms, for a number of years in production environments driving millions of transactions.

As part of our ethos to have a positive impact on our wider community we are open sourcing them for everyone's benefit. We've also included the last three years of development history, showing how the utilities have evolved. Please let us know if you find the code useful in your own projects!

We have carefully sanitised the code to protect our commercial customers interests, but if you do manage to spot any sensitive data please notify us directly using our support email.

## Using the libraries

All the code documented here is available on GitHub, and is also available, in compiled form, on nuget.org, as a collection of 10 inter-connected NuGets and can be installed into your .NET projects using NuGet. Alternatively, you can look for the individual NuGet files, or the compiled binaries in the releases.

The official NuGets are strongly named and digitally signed by Web Applications UK, using a separate, secure process, that guarantees the NuGets authenticity. Although you can build your own NuGets from the source included here, the ability to upload them to nuget.org is not provided to protect casual users. If you wish to use a customised version of a library prior to a formal release, we recommend building and including the dll directly (but remember to include the License!).

We will accept relevant pull requests, and issues, so please consider contributing.
